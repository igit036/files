geoserver - problem of the filesize of the WAR file of geoserver.
At default tomcat only accepts 50MB in the WAR files to upload, open with notepad the file: Tomcat 9.0\webapps\manager\WEB-INF\web.xml
and find the lines with the text: <max-file-size> and <max-request-size>.
Increase that value, for example:
<max-file-size>92428800</max-file-size>
<max-request-size>92428800</max-request-size>
Restart tomcat and try again.

#Little helps to use SRTM (elevation maps) in geoserver

you can download SRTM data at http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/ or http://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/ (90 meters or 3 seconds arc resolution of map is better)
install GDAL tools and python to work with SRTM http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/DownloadingGdalBinaries
install geoserver image pyramid plugin
generate a pyramid from SRTM data with gdal_retile command from GDAL tools
create a layer from generated pyramid ( a guide is available here)
